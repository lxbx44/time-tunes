## Build
 1. Install the [tauri build dependencies](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#setting-up-linux)
 2. Install `npm` with your package manager. If you use `pnpm` you'll need to edit `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
 3. Install `tauri-cli` with `cargo`
 4. Run `cargo tauri build` in the root of the project. (use `dev` instead of `build` to run a developement build)

### Pre-commit:
 - Remember `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` have to be the same version
